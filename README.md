# Programming-Fundamentals

# A compilation of mini projects I have undertaken during a programming fundementals course. Through this repo I intend to demonstrate my skillset and level of understanding in several areas, including: 
algorithmic development; iterative and recursive methods; object oriented design; nested, linked, and graph data structures; trees and search algorithms such as DFS, BFS; and divide & conquer implementations.
